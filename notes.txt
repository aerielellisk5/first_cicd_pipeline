Things that need to happen
    1. run tests
    2. check the formatting
    3. deploy the code using surge


Master --> protected
    -wiil have deployable code to production

Develop --> protected
    - will contain the latest development code

- need to open a PR first and then approved to be merged in with both branches

1. Feature 1. --> pull request --> run workflow 
    a. formatting is approved
    b. wont break any tests
2. once all that is true, code needs to be review, and then it will be merged into the develop branch

3. Another workflow
    a. checkout code formatting
    b. deploy code to staging environment server

4.  Once we have multle features have gone through this, we can then open a pull request into master
    a. Another workflow
        - test still passs  
        - code is formatting properly

5. Merged into master   
    a. another workflow to do the same thing
    b. deploys code to production server

Job Failure --> Create an Issue --> send slack messsage to team 
release created --> send a slack message to team 

Okay so, for this project, here are some token things that I'll need
